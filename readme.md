# autoextractor
Automatically extract archives in your download folder - once. Extraction is done via p7zip - ```apt-get install p7zip-full p7zip-rar```.
Extracted archives are placed in a new folder each, so no worries about messed up folders. 

Caution: 7z is set to ```-y``` and COULD OVERWRITE edited files!

Clone it somewhere, set it to autorun on boot and lean back.
